# Introduction

It is possible to run Virtual Machines inside Virtual Machines (VMs). That is called Nested Virtualization. [\[1\]](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Nested_Virtualization#cite_note-1)

# Qubes

Running VirtualBox, KVM or Qubes inside Qubes is difficult. Not offically supported by the Qubes developers. It is unrelated to Whonix ™. You can learn more about the current state of things by searching the qubes-devel and qubes-users mailing lists for terms such as VirtualBox, KVM and/or nested virtualization.

# VirtualBox inside VirtualBox

Be sure to change your host key._VirtualBox → Preferences → Input → Host Key_. The "outside" and the "inside" Host Key must differ, otherwise you can not leave the VM "inside" anymore.

Using ACPI[\[2\]](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Nested_Virtualization#cite_note-2)and IOAPIC[\[3\]](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Nested_Virtualization#cite_note-3)[\[4\]](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Nested_Virtualization#cite_note-4)for all VM's, speeds up the "inside" VM a lot. These settings are in use for Whonix ™ VMs by default.

VirtualBox does not support VT in VT yet.[\[5\]](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Nested_Virtualization#cite_note-5)So the "inside" VM might be slow depending on your host's performance. Inside the "inside" VM, disable VT._VirtualBox → right click on VM → Settings → System → Acceleration → uncheck "Enable VT-x/AMD-V"_

Oracle VM VirtualBox supportsnested virtualizationon host systems that run AMD CPUs. This feature enables the passthrough of hardware virtualization functions to the guest VM. That means that you can install a hypervisor, such as Oracle VM VirtualBox, Oracle VM Server or KVM, on an Oracle VM VirtualBox guest. You can then create and run VMs within the guest VM.

You can enable the nested virtualization feature in one of the following ways:

*   From the VirtualBox Manager, select theEnable Nested VT-x/AMD-Vcheck box on theProcessortab. To disable the feature, deselect the check box.
    
*   Use the `--nested-hw-virt` option of theVBoxManage modifyvmcommand to enable or disable nested virtualization. See [VBoxManage modifyvm](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E97728_01/E97727/html/vboxmanage-modifyvm.html).
